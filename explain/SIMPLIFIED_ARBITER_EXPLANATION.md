# Simplified Arbiter Implementation

## Overview
The arbiter is a **central manager** that coordinates all search operations in the correct sequence. It ensures that all threads start and end properly, preventing orphaned processes.

## How It Works

### 1. **Main Function: `runSearchWorkflow(params)`**
This is the **only function** you need to call. It does everything:
- Starts the search
- Waits for all file mappings to complete
- Runs debug mappings
- Displays results
- Waits for everything to finish

### 2. **The Workflow Steps**
```
STEP 1: Start ripgrep search
         ↓
STEP 2: Wait for search + file mappings to complete
         ↓
STEP 3: Run debug mappings
         ↓
STEP 4: Display results
         ↓
STEP 5: Wait for result display to complete
         ↓
DONE: Signal completion
```

### 3. **Key Components**

#### **ThreadArbiter Class**
- **`m_pendingFiles`**: List of files waiting to be mapped
- **`m_completedFiles`**: List of files that have been mapped
- **`m_searchCompleted`**: Whether the main search is done
- **`m_resultDisplayCompleted`**: Whether result display is done
- **`m_mutex`**: Protects shared data from multiple threads

#### **Helper Functions**
- **`startSearch()`**: Starts the ripgrep search
- **`startFileMapping(filePath)`**: Starts mapping a single file
- **`checkIfAllDone()`**: Checks if we can proceed to next step
- **`startResultDisplay()`**: Starts displaying results

### 4. **How to Use**

#### **In RGSearchDialog:**
```cpp
// Just call this one function - the arbiter handles everything!
kSearchBun->startArbiterSearch(params);
```

#### **The Arbiter Does:**
1. **Starts ripgrep search** → finds files and matches
2. **For each file found** → starts file mapping process
3. **Waits for all mappings** → ensures nothing is orphaned
4. **Runs debug mappings** → shows what was found
5. **Displays results** → shows matches to user
6. **Signals completion** → everything is done

### 5. **Benefits of This Approach**

✅ **Simple**: Only one function to call
✅ **Safe**: No orphaned processes
✅ **Sequential**: Everything happens in the right order
✅ **Logged**: Every step is logged with thread start/end
✅ **Centralized**: All coordination in one place

### 6. **Thread Safety**
- Uses `QMutex` to protect shared data
- All file mapping requests are queued safely
- Completion status is tracked properly

### 7. **Error Handling**
- If any step fails, the arbiter waits and logs
- No process can be orphaned because the arbiter waits for completion
- All threads are properly managed

## Summary
The arbiter is a **simple, safe, and centralized** way to manage complex multi-threaded search operations. Instead of trying to coordinate multiple threads manually, you just call `runSearchWorkflow()` and the arbiter handles everything else.
