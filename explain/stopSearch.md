🛑 Stop Search Button Implementation
1. UI Components Added
Stop Button: Red "⏹️ Stop" button positioned next to the Search button
Visual Design: Red gradient styling with hover/press effects
State Management: Initially disabled, enabled only during active searches
2. Stop Functionality
The stopSearch() function in MainWindow performs comprehensive cleanup:
Process Management
Ripgrep Process: Stops any running ripgrep process via m_searchBun->stopSearch()
JSON Parsing: Stops background JSON parsing via collapsibleSearchResults->stopParsing()
Background Highlighting: Stops file highlighting via fileContentView->stopBackgroundHighlighting()
Worker Threads: Stops any running worker threads
State Reset
Search State: Resets to SearchState::IDLE
UI State: Re-enables Search button, disables Stop button
Status Updates: Updates status file to "IDLE" state
Complete Cleanup: Calls KCompleteCleanUp() for thorough reset
3. Supporting Methods Added
KSearchBun::stopSearch()
Terminates ripgrep process gracefully (2-second timeout)
Falls back to force-kill if needed
Proper process cleanup and memory management
CollapsibleSearchResults::stopParsing()
Stops JSON parsing thread (1-second timeout)
Stops watchdog timers
Clears pending data structures
Hides progress bars
Updates UI to show "Parsing stopped by user"
4. Button State Management
The setSearchButton() method now manages both buttons:
IDLE: Search button enabled, Stop button disabled
SEARCHING: Search button disabled, Stop button enabled
PROCESSING: Search button disabled, Stop button enabled
5. Error Handling
Exception Safety: All stop operations wrapped in try-catch blocks
Force Reset: Even if errors occur, application returns to idle state
Logging: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
�� How It Works
User clicks "Stop" during any search operation
Immediate Response: All processes are terminated within 1-2 seconds
State Reset: Application returns to idle state
UI Update: Buttons return to normal state, progress indicators clear
Status Update: Heartbeat system reports "IDLE" state
�� Benefits
Immediate Control: Users can stop long-running searches instantly
Resource Cleanup: Proper termination prevents memory leaks
UI Responsiveness: Application remains responsive during stop operations
Error Recovery: Robust error handling ensures application stability
Status Monitoring: Watchdog system can detect and report stop operations
The Stop Search button provides users with immediate control over search operations, making the application much more user-friendly for handling large searches or when users need to interrupt ongoing operations.
