# Fix GitHub Pages Deployment

## The Problem
The deployment is failing because of permission issues with the `gh-pages` branch. The GitHub Actions bot doesn't have permission to push to the repository.

## The Solution
We need to change GitHub Pages to use GitHub Actions instead of the `gh-pages` branch.

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Go to GitHub Pages Settings
- Navigate to: `https://github.com/amirke/TotalSearch/settings/pages`

### 2. Change Source
- **Current:** "Deploy from a branch" → `gh-pages` branch
- **Change to:** "GitHub Actions"

### 3. Save Changes
- Click "Save" to apply the new configuration

### 4. Check Deployment
- Go to: `https://github.com/amirke/TotalSearch/actions`
- Look for the "Deploy Website to GitHub Pages" workflow
- It should now succeed with ✅ green checkmark

## Why This Works
- **No branch pushing** - Uses GitHub's internal deployment system
- **Proper permissions** - GitHub Actions has built-in permissions for this
- **Official method** - Uses GitHub's recommended deployment approach

## Expected Result
- Website will be available at: `https://amirke.github.io/TotalSearch/`
- All your updates (pricing, Q&A, download fix) will be live
